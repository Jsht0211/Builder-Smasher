# Builder-Smasher

## Basic information

It uses deepseek(or gemma for image to text) to do english builder automatically



## How to download the tool?

Go to the release page and click on 'Builder-Smasher.exe' to download the executable file



## How to use it?

You need to have a hugging face token(for authentication) to use the AI
(If you don't know how to get one, a tutorial is available in the executable file. Run it and follow the steps.)

Once you've successfully entered your token, fill in the basic information such as:
-the number of exercises you want to do,
-whether or not to enable image to text, and
-your username and password

After that, you can just be away from keyboard and wait for the exercises to be completed



## Special reminders

The AI may not be correct all the time. It will sometimes make a lot of mistakes. So the accuracy may be a little bit low, but the average accuracy is above 70%

The use of AI **consumes your tokens for inference usage**(not the one for authentication mentioned before)

If an error occurs, it may be either caused by you running out of tokens, or the AI answering the questions wrongly. Run the file again and enter your token. If the program says that it is an invalid token, that means you have used all of your tokens for inference usage. You can wait till next month when your token quota is reset, or just create a new account. If the program keeps going, that means the AI made mistakes. You can fill in your information again and wait for the tool to help you complete the exercises
